Java 10 updates -
1) var keyword -
  Java 10 allows you to declare a local variable without specifying its type. The type of variable 
  will be inferred from type of actual object created.
      var str = "hello world"; 
  var variable must be initialized at the time of declaration otherwise compilation error comes.
  var is not a keyword so can be used as a variable name.
     var var = 10;
  Usage allowed as - Local variables with initializers, Indexes in the enhanced for-loop, 
   Locals declared in a traditional for-loop
  Usage NOT allowed as - Method parameters, Constructor parameters, Method return types, Class fields,
   Catch formals

2) Unmodifiable Collection -
  	List.copyOf(), Set.copyOf() and Map.copyOf() methods create new collection instances 
  	from existing instances. These methods take whole collection as an argument and create immutable 
  	copy of that collection. Null values is not allowed.
  	Collectors.toUnmodifiableList(), Collectors.toUnmodifiableSet() and Collectors.toUnmodifiableMap() 
  	methods allows to create unmodifiable collections without creating new instances. Null values is not allowed.
    
Note: Different between of(), copyOf() and toUnmodifiableXxx() methods -
of() - Java 9 method to create unmodifiable collection. It takes individual elements as arguments.
copyOf() - Java 10 method to create unmodifiable collection. It takes whole collection as 
           argument.
toUnmodifiableXxx() - Java 10 method helps to create an unmodifiable Collection from a Stream.       

Note: Difference between Collections.unmodifiableXxx() and Collectors.toUnmodifiableXxx().
Collections.unmodifiableXxx() -
      If changes are done to the backing collection, they are visible through the unmodifiable collection.
Collectors.toUnmodifiableXxx() - 
      If changes are done to the backing collection, they are not visible through the unmodifiable collection.
