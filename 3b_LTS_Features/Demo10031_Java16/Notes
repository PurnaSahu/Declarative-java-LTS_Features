Java 16 updates -
A preview feature is a new feature whose design, specification, and implementation are complete, but 
which is not permanent, which means that the feature may exist in a different form or not at all in 
future JDK releases.
Every preview feature is described by a JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) that defines its scope and
sketches its design. For example, JEP 325 describes the JDK 12 preview feature for switch expressions.
