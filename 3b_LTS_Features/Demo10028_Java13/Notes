Java 13 updates -
A preview feature is a new feature whose design, specification, and implementation are complete, but 
which is not permanent, which means that the feature may exist in a different form or not at all in 
future JDK releases.
Every preview feature is described by a JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) that defines its scope and
sketches its design. For example, JEP 325 describes the JDK 12 preview feature for switch expressions.
 
javac --enable-preview --release 13 Example.java
java --source 13 --enable-preview Example.java

1) Switch Expressions - Preview feature  - JEP 354
  Replacement of the keyword 'break' in the switch expression by 'yield'. The yield statement exits 
  the switch and returns the result of the current branch, similar to a return.
   
2) Text blocks - Preview feature - JEP 355
   Used to increase redability of the code written in non-java. e.g. SQL, HTML, JSON.
   It makes it simple to construct multiline strings. A pair of triple-double quotations must surround
   the multiline string.
   String htmlBeforeJava13 = "<html>\n" +
			  					"   <body>\n" +
			  					"      <p>Hello, World</p>\n" +
			  					"   </body>\n" +
			  					"</html>\n";
   
   String htmlInJava13 = """
          			  <html>
              		<body>
               				 <p>Hello, Text Blocks</p>
              			  </body>
            			</html>
            	  """;
            
    String json = """
                {
                    "name":"IPad",
                    "price":20000
                }
                """;        
                
   The opening and closing triple quotes must be in a separate line. The actual content starts with 
   the second line. This increases the readability of the source code, as the indentation of the first
   line is displayed correctly in the source text.
   Text blocks are replaced by normal strings at compile time; in the byte code, you can no longer see
   how the string was originally defined.
   Inside the text blocks, we can freely use newlines and quotes without the need for escaping line breaks. 
   It allows us to include literal fragments of HTML, JSON, SQL.
   In the resulting String, the (base) indentation and the first newline are not included.
