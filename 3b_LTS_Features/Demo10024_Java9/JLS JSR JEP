JLS - Java Language Specifications
      This is a specification for the Java Language. The JLS specifies the syntax for the Java 
      programming language and other rules that say what is or is not a valid Java program.
      
JSR - Java Specification Request
      A JSR is a document created as part of the Java Community Process (JCP) that is setting the 
      scope for a team of people to develop a new specification.
      The actual specification of the feature happens in this stage, can be either coming through 
      Groups/Projects, JEPs or from individual JCP (Java Community Process) members.
      
JEP - Java Enhancement Proposal
      A JEP is a document that is proposing an enhancement to Java core technology. These are 
      proposals typically for enhancements that are not ready to be specified yet. JEPs allow 
      promoting a new specification informally. Accepted JEPs become a part of the JDK roadmap 
      and assigned a version number.  
      
The relationship between JEPs, JSRs and specifications -
      JEPs propose and develop experimental ideas to the point where they could be specified. Not 
      all JEPs come to fruition.
      JSRs take mature ideas (e.g. resulting from a JEP), and produce a new specification, or 
      modifications to an existing specification. Not all JSRs come to fruition. A specification is
      a common work product of a JSR. 
      The JLS is an example of a specification. Others include the JVM specification, the Servlet 
      and JSP specifications, the EJB specifications and so on.
