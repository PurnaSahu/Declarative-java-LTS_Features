Java 17 updates -
A preview feature is a new feature whose design, specification, and implementation are complete, but 
which is not permanent, which means that the feature may exist in a different form or not at all in 
future JDK releases.
Every preview feature is described by a JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) that defines its scope and
sketches its design. For example, JEP 325 describes the JDK 12 preview feature for switch expressions.
 
javac --enable-preview --release 17 Example.java
java --source 17 --enable-preview Example.java

1) Pattern matching in switch - Preview feature - JEP 406
   Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for switch expressions and statements,
   along with extensions to the language of patterns. Extending pattern matching to switch allows an
   expression to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that complex
   data-oriented queries can be expressed concisely and safely.
   Allow case labels with patterns rather than just constants.
   
2) Sealed Classes/Interfaces - (Preview feature of Java 15)
   Preview feature became permanant in Java 17.
